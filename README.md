# booktap-frontend-ui

BookTap is a home for books and comments related to those books.

Plently of times I've read books. But, I can't remember my favorite quotes or thoughts I had while reading the books. BookTap solves that problem. It gets you started with a collection of books and you can add your own as well. 

This project runs with a Vanilla Javascript front-end found in this repository and a Rails backend with a Postgres database. Bootstrap is used for styling. 

## Installation

Make sure you start the Rails backend here:
